Agile Scrum Ceremonies
--------------------

The four scrum ceremonies are:

Sprint Planning
--------------------
Sprint Planning is the scrum ceremony designed to make sure the team is prepared to get the right things done every sprint.

The scrum team – product owner, development team & scrum master.


Daily Scrum
--------------------
The Daily Scrum is the team’s chance to get together, define a plan for the day’s work, and identify any blockers.

The Scrum Master and the Development Team. The Product Owner is an optional attendee. On occasion, outside stakeholders can be invited to listen in to the daily scrum.

Sprint Review
--------------------
The Sprint Review is the scrum ceremony where all work completed during the sprint can be showcased the stakeholders.

The scrum team – product owner, development team & scrum master – and typically a mixture of management, outside stakeholders, customers, and even developers from other projects. In terms of who needs to be there, this scrum ceremony is more fluid than the others. The Product Owner and Scrum Master should be discussing who ought to be involved prior to the Sprint Review and work to ensure they’re in attendance.

Sprint Retrospective
--------------------
The Sprint Retrospective is the final scrum ceremony in the sequence that allows the team to look back on the work that was just completed and identify items that could be improved.

The Scrum Master and the Development Team. The Product Owner is an optional attendee. There should be no outside stakeholders involved in the retro.
